Over the years, he has garnered over 4.82 million subscribers, with around 300k coming over the previous 30 day.
<br /><br />Ankush ff is a legendary Free Fire player from India. Basically, he is an emulator player.
He is one of the most popular Free Fire players whose Youtube content run by only his gameplay.

We can know Ajju bhai, Amit bhai, Gyan Sujan Etc. But they are running their channel using their voice cover or fun or giveaway.

But Ankush is a legendary player like Mina server players B2k, BNL, Stylus. I love his gameplay very much.

Anyway, Ankushâ€™s real name is Ankush Tripathi & his nationality is Indian. And this season he is now on Grandmaster Top 1. This season he is pushing with his friends on squad.
